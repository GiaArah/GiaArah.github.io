### String Lights Level Design:

Primary objectives of string lights level:
- Highlight Capri, the youngest sister with a "light ray" ability
- Feeling of a magical, "full circle" narrative moment where the player returns to the beginning of the game and restores the magical light of the town
- Emotional beats: serene, beautiful, awe-inspiring, playful

Contributions:
- Designed "lantern" encounters where players can light various interactable lanterns
- Built platforming sequence across magical pathways
- Created final mirror puzzle sequence in town plaza
