- Incorporated physics-based destruction sound effects into 5 multiplayer maps: Derail, Estate, Favela, Invasion, and Terminal using CoD proprietary engine, APE, and custom CSV-based audio engine, Audio Manager
  <!-- - Implemented in CoD proprietary engine, APE, and custom CSV-based audio engine, Audio Manager -->
  <!-- - Used knowledge of audio design fundamentals to make custom sound banks for each audio asset  -->
    <!-- - Configured audio asset sound banks, specifying parameters such as volume, pitch, fade, and bussing structures -->
    <!-- - Ensured efficient memory usage by reusing audio asset aliases across physics sounds, tightly trimming wav file tails, and reducing sounds to mono when stereo is unnecessary -->
- Designed and implemented 10 ambient emitter sound effects for various mechanical environment props across campaign and multiplayer maps
- Refinined and edited 6 field recording sessions, adding metadata for seamless integration into Sledgehammer Games Audio Libraries
