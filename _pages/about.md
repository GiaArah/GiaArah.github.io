My Name is Giavanna, but I go by Gia!

I'm an all-encompassing designer of sounds, code, and games in my last year of university studying Computer Science & Game Development at USC. I love all aspects of the game development, and my goal is to bridge my interests in both design-focused and technical roles. I love audio design and programming as a means to do so.

I find myself dabbling in 3D Modeling from time to time as a hobby; but outside of games, I love hiking, swimming, photography, and making short films.

<!-- I've been playing games for as long as I can remember, and it's been a dream come true to have worked as a game developer for 4 years. -->
