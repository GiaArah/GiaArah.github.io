My Name is Giavanna, but I go by Gia! I'm an all-encompassing designer of sounds, code, and games.

In May 2025, recieved an M.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Computer Science & Game Development. I'm currently working at Blizzard Entertainment as a sound designer for Diablo IV.

I love all aspects of game development, and my goal is to bridge my interests in both design-focused and technical roles. I love sound design and programming as a means to do so.

Outside of games, I love hiking, swimming, [photography](https://giaarah.github.io/inherentlygia_photo/), and making short films.
