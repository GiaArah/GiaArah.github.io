## Sorelle
### Role: Creative Director

*Developed in C++, Unreal Engine 5.2*

Sorelle (Sor-elle-eh) is a student capstone project under USC Games' Advanced Games Project (AGP), developed in Unreal Engine 5.2.

Sorelle is a whimsical 3D, 3rd person puzzle-platforming game with a twist: you play as three characters simultaneously. The sisters gain magical abilities and must use them to help the townspeople of the Sicilian-inspired island Isola Chiara fix their preparations for the festival and repair the town Cathedral stained glass, restoring its magic before it's too late.
